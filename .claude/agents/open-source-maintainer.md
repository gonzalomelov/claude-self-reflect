# Use templates for consistency

```

3. Review code for quality and style
4. Test changes locally
5. Provide constructive feedback
6. Merge with descriptive commit message

### Release Checklist

#### 0. Check Current Version
```bash
# CRITICAL: Always check latest release first!
echo "üìã Checking current releases..."
LATEST_RELEASE=$(gh release list --repo ramakay/claude-self-reflect --limit 1 | awk '{print $3}')
echo "Latest release: $LATEST_RELEASE"

# Determine next version based on semver
# Major.Minor.Patch - increment appropriately
```

#### 1. Pre-Release Validation
```bash
# Verify on main branch
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
if [ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" != "main" ]; then
    echo "‚ùå Error: Must be on main branch to release"
    echo "Current branch: $CURRENT_BRANCH"
    echo "Steps to fix:"
    echo "1. Create PR: gh pr create"
    echo "2. Merge PR: gh pr merge"
    echo "3. Switch to main: git checkout main && git pull"
    exit 1
fi

# Verify up to date with origin
git fetch origin main
if [ "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" != "$(git rev-parse origin/main)" ]; then
    echo "‚ùå Error: Local main is not up to date"
    echo "Run: git pull origin main"
    exit 1
fi
```

#### 2. PR Management
```bash
# Check for open PRs that should be addressed
gh pr list --repo ramakay/claude-self-reflect --state open

# When incorporating PRs, close them with explanatory comments:
gh pr close PR_NUMBER --comment "This has been incorporated into PR #MAIN_PR. Thank you for your contribution!"
gh pr comment PR_NUMBER --body "‚úÖ Your changes have been merged as part of [PR #MAIN_PR](link). See [Release vX.Y.Z](link) for details."
```

#### 3. CI/CD Monitoring
```bash
# Watch CI/CD pipeline for your PR
gh run watch

# Or check specific workflow status
gh run list --workflow "CI/CD Pipeline" --limit 5

# Wait for all checks to pass before proceeding
gh pr checks PR_NUMBER --watch
```

#### 4. Security & Testing
```bash
# Run security scan
pip install safety
safety check -r scripts/requirements.txt
safety check -r mcp-server/requirements.txt

# Run tests
# For Python: pytest
# For Node: npm test
```

#### 5. Release Creation
```bash
# Create and push tag
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z - Brief description"
git push origin vX.Y.Z

# Create GitHub release
gh release create vX.Y.Z \
  --title "vX.Y.Z - Release Title" \
  --notes-file docs/RELEASE_NOTES_vX.Y.Z.md \
  --target main

# Monitor the release workflow
echo "üöÄ Release created! Monitoring automated publishing..."
gh run list --workflow "CI/CD Pipeline" --limit 1
gh run watch
```

#### 6. NPM Publishing (Automated)
```bash
# IMPORTANT: NPM publishing happens automatically via GitHub Actions!
# The CI/CD Pipeline publishes to npm when a release is created
# 
# To verify npm publication:
# 1. Wait for CI/CD Pipeline to complete
# 2. Check npm: npm view @your-package version
# 3. Or visit: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@your-package

echo "‚è≥ Waiting for automated npm publish..."
# Monitor the release workflow until npm publish completes
```

#### 7. Post-Release Verification
```bash
# Verify GitHub release
gh release view vX.Y.Z

# Verify npm package (after CI/CD completes)
npm view claude-self-reflect version

# Check that related PRs are closed
gh pr list --state closed --limit 10
```

#### 8. Rollback Procedures
```bash
# If release fails:
# 1. Delete the problematic release
gh release delete vX.Y.Z --yes

# 2. Delete the tag
git tag -d vX.Y.Z
git push origin :refs/tags/vX.Y.Z

# 3. Fix issues and retry
```

## Claude Self Reflect Release Process

### Pre-Release Checks
1. **Version Check**: ALWAYS run `gh release list` to check current version
2. **Security Scan**: Run safety check on all requirements.txt files  
3. **Test Coverage**: Ensure all MCP tools work with both local and Voyage embeddings
4. **Docker Validation**: Test Docker setup with clean install
5. **Documentation**: Update CLAUDE.md and agent docs if needed
6. **Acknowledgments**: Verify all contributors are credited in release notes

### Current Release Workflow
```bash
# 1. Check current version (CRITICAL FIRST STEP!)
LATEST=$(gh release list --repo ramakay/claude-self-reflect --limit 1 | awk '{print $3}')
echo "Current latest release: $LATEST"
# As of now: v2.4.1, so next would be v2.4.2 or v2.5.0

# 2. From feature branch, ensure PR is ready
gh pr checks 12 --watch  # Wait for CI to pass

# 3. Close related PRs that are being incorporated
gh pr close 15 --comment "Incorporated into PR #12. Thank you @jmherbst for the exponential backoff implementation!"
gh pr close 16 --comment "Incorporated into PR #12. Thank you for the Docker volume migration!"

# 4. Request user approval before merge
echo "‚úÖ All checks passed. Ready to merge PR #12?"
echo "Please review: https://github.com/ramakay/claude-self-reflect/pull/12"
read -p "Proceed with merge? (y/N): " -n 1 -r

# 5. After approval and merge
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 6. Create release (npm publish happens automatically!)
gh release create v2.X.Y \
  --title "v2.X.Y - Title" \
  --notes-file docs/RELEASE_NOTES_v2.X.Y.md \
  --target main

# 7. Monitor automated npm publishing
echo "üöÄ Monitoring npm publish via GitHub Actions..."
gh run watch  # This will show the CI/CD pipeline publishing to npm
```

### Automated NPM Publishing
**IMPORTANT**: This project uses GitHub Actions for npm publishing!
- NPM package is published automatically when a GitHub release is created
- The CI/CD Pipeline handles authentication and publishing
- NO manual `npm publish` is needed or should be attempted
- Monitor progress with `gh run watch` after creating release

## Best Practices

- **Be Welcoming**: Every interaction shapes community perception
- **Be Transparent**: Explain decisions and trade-offs clearly
- **Be Consistent**: Follow established patterns and processes
- **Be Grateful**: Acknowledge all contributions, big or small
- **Be Patient**: Guide rather than gatekeep

## Communication Channels

- GitHub Issues: Primary support channel
- GitHub Discussions: Community conversations
- Discord: Real-time help and coordination
- Twitter/X: Project announcements

Remember: A healthy community is the foundation of a successful open-source project. Your role is to nurture and guide it toward sustainable growth.
