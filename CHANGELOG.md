### Changed
- Reflection-specialist agent completely restructured to use XML format
  - Easier parsing for main agent without regex
  - Structured data extraction with predictable field locations
  - Error responses also follow XML format for consistency

### Benefits
- Main agent can extract specific fields like `<score>`, `<project>`, `<timestamp>` directly
- No ambiguity in data boundaries or formatting
- Extensible schema allows adding new fields without breaking parsers
- Better integration capabilities for downstream tools

## [2.4.3] - 2025-07-28
