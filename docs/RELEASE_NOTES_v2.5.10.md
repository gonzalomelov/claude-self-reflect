# Release Notes - v2.5.10

## Summary
Emergency hotfix to resolve critical MCP server startup failure that prevented users from accessing reflection tools. This release removes unreachable dead code that was causing IndentationError during server initialization.

## Critical Fix

### MCP Server Startup Failure
- **Issue**: Version 2.5.9 shipped with dead code after return statements in three MCP tool functions
- **Impact**: Server failed to start with IndentationError, making reflection tools completely inaccessible
- **Root Cause**: Incomplete code cleanup when implementing MCP architectural limitation messages
- **Solution**: Removed 115+ lines of unreachable code while preserving proper error handling

## Technical Details

### Affected Functions
- `quick_search()`: Removed 32 lines of unreachable parsing/formatting code
- `search_summary()`: Removed 57 lines of unreachable result analysis code
- `get_more_results()`: Removed 26 lines of unreachable pagination logic

### Files Modified
- `mcp-server/src/server.py`: Cleaned up dead code after return statements
- `CHANGELOG.md`: Updated with emergency hotfix details
- `package.json`: Bumped version to 2.5.10
- `mcp-server/pyproject.toml`: Bumped version to 2.5.10

## Verification
- Python compilation now succeeds without errors
- MCP server starts successfully
- All reflection tools are accessible and functional
- No functional regressions introduced

## Installation
```bash
npm install -g claude-self-reflect@2.5.10
```

## Next Steps
After installing this hotfix:

1. **Restart Claude Code completely** for MCP changes to take effect
2. **Verify MCP connection**: Run `claude mcp list` to confirm server is listed
3. **Test reflection tools**: Try using reflection tools to confirm functionality
