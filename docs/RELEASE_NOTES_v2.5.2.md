# Release Notes - v2.5.2

## Summary
Critical bug fix release addressing state file compatibility issues that prevented successful baseline imports. This patch ensures compatibility with both legacy and new state file formats, enabling reliable full project imports.

## Changes

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed state file compatibility issue in import script** - Resolved AttributeError when processing old imported-files.json format
  - Modified scripts/import-conversations-unified.py (lines 84-98) to handle both string timestamps (legacy) and dictionary metadata (new format)
  - Ensures graceful fallback for existing installations with older state files
  - Prevents import failures during full baseline imports

### Repository Maintenance
- **Major cleanup completed** - Removed 22 test files and debug artifacts
  - Deleted obsolete test files (test-cloud-import.py, test-cloud-mode.py, test-end-to-end.py)
  - Removed debug logs from scripts/trigger-import.py  
  - Cleared temporary memory logs and test configuration files
  - Reclaimed 528.4MB of Docker space through cleanup
  - Comprehensive cleanup report available at docs/cleanup/CLEANUP_REPORT.md

## Technical Details

### State File Format Evolution
The imported-files.json state file has evolved from storing simple timestamps:
```json
{
  "project-name": "2025-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

To storing rich metadata:
```json
{
  "project-name": {
    "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
    "chunks": 150,
    "files": 12
  }
}
```

This release ensures compatibility with both formats, preventing import crashes.

### Impact
- **Baseline Imports**: Now work reliably with existing state files
- **Universal Compatibility**: Works with both LOCAL (FastEmbed) and CLOUD (Voyage AI) embedding modes
- **Performance**: 3980 chunks from 32 projects imported successfully in testing
- **Search Quality**: Historical conversations (12+ days old) remain searchable via MCP

## Verification
- Cleared corrupted state file and ran full baseline import successfully
- Verified MCP search functionality with historical conversations
- Tested compatibility with both embedding modes
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Installation
```bash
npm install -g claude-self-reflect@2.5.2
```
