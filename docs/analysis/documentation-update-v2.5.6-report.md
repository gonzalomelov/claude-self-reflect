## New Features Documented

### Tool Output Extraction (v2.5.6)
- **Purpose**: Captures git changes and tool outputs for enhanced cross-agent discovery
- **Capabilities**:
  - Extracts up to 15 tool outputs (500 chars each) per conversation
  - Parses git diff/show/status outputs to identify modified files
  - Enables semantic search of tool execution results
  - Two-pass JSONL parsing for complete output capture

### New MCP Tools (v2.5.6)
1. **`search_by_file`**:
   - Find conversations that referenced specific files
   - Particularly useful for git operations tracking
   - Supports project-specific and cross-project search
   
2. **`search_by_concept`**:
   - Search by conceptual themes (security, docker, testing, etc.)
   - Uses semantic analysis of tool outputs and content
   - Configurable file inclusion in results

## Technical Details Documented

### Performance Impact
- Minimal overhead (~10ms per conversation) for tool output extraction
- Storage increase of ~2-5KB per conversation with tool outputs
- Backward compatibility maintained with v1 metadata

### Implementation Details
- Modified files: `streaming-importer.py`, `import-conversations-unified.py`
- Metadata schema upgraded to version 2
- Two-pass JSONL parsing implemented for complete capture
