# üöÄ Claude Self Reflect v2.4.15 Released - Feedback Requested!

Dear Claude Self Reflect Community,

We're excited to announce the release of **v2.4.15**, which includes critical memory optimizations and a new developer experience enhancement.

## üîß What's Fixed

### Memory Optimization (Finally!)
We've resolved the frustrating Docker memory issues that many of you reported:
- **Before**: Import processes consuming 500MB+ and getting killed
- **After**: Stable operation under 15MB throughout imports
- **Solution**: Pre-cached FastEmbed models in Docker images

### Docker Resource Optimization
- Watcher container memory reduced from 2GB to 1GB
- Qdrant remains at 2GB for optimal performance
- No more OOM kills during imports!

## ‚ú® What's New

### /importcompact Command
A streamlined workflow for preserving conversations:
```bash
# Import current conversation and get compact reminder
/importcompact focus on memory optimization discussion
```

This combines the import and compact steps, making it easier to preserve important discussions before context limits.

## üì¶ How to Upgrade

### NPM Users
```bash
npm update -g claude-self-reflect
```

### Docker Users
```bash
docker compose down
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```
