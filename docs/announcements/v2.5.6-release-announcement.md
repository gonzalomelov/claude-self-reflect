# Claude Self-Reflect v2.5.6: Tool Output Extraction

**Updated**: August 11, 2025 | **Version**: 2.5.6

Claude Self-Reflect v2.5.6 introduces Tool Output Extraction, a significant enhancement that enables searchability of git file changes and command outputs across all Claude conversations.

## Version 2.5.6 Release Notes

**Documentation** | **Migration Guide** | **API Reference**

This release focuses on improving cross-agent collaboration by capturing and indexing tool execution outputs, particularly git operations and file modifications. The enhanced metadata extraction system enables developers to discover work performed by different Claude agents through file-based and concept-based search capabilities.

## Key Features

### Enhanced Metadata Extraction
- **Tool Output Capture**: Preserves the first 500 characters of each tool execution result
- **Git Operation Parsing**: Automatically extracts file paths from `git diff`, `git show`, and `git status` commands
- **Cross-Agent Discovery**: Enables discovery of work performed by other Claude agents through file modification tracking

### New Search Capabilities

The following search functions are now available:

```python
# Search conversations by file path
search_by_file(file_path="src/utils.py")

# Search conversations by development concept
search_by_concept(concept="docker")

# Perform quick overview searches
quick_search(query="authentication bug")
```

### Technical Specifications
- Maximum of 15 tool outputs captured per conversation
- Maximum of 20 git file changes tracked per conversation
- Storage overhead: 2-5KB per conversation
- Processing overhead: Approximately 10ms per conversation

## Use Cases

### Team Collaboration
Developers can now search for conversations where specific files were modified, enabling better coordination across multiple Claude agents working on the same codebase.

### Debugging History
Historical git operations are now searchable, allowing developers to trace when and how specific files were changed during debugging sessions.

### Knowledge Transfer
File modification patterns across conversations provide insights into system dependencies and architectural decisions.

## Installation and Upgrade

### Docker Installation
```bash
docker compose down
git pull origin main
docker compose build
docker compose --profile mcp up -d
```

### Historical Data Import
To apply tool output extraction to existing conversations:
```bash
docker compose run --rm importer
```

## Implementation Details

### Metadata Schema Version 2
```json
{
  "metadata_version": 2,
  "git_file_changes": ["README.md", "src/utils.py"],
  "tool_outputs": [
    {
      "tool": "Bash",
      "command": "git diff --stat",
      "output_preview": "4 files changed, 162 insertions...",
      "output_length": 1247
    }
  ]
}
```

### Architecture
- **Two-pass JSONL Parsing**: Initial pass collects tool outputs, second pass matches outputs with corresponding tool invocations
- **Git Output Pattern Recognition**: Regular expression patterns extract file paths from standard git command outputs
- **Automatic Indexing**: The streaming importer processes new conversations automatically without manual intervention

## Compatibility

This release maintains full backward compatibility with existing installations. All previous search functionality remains unchanged, and conversations indexed with earlier versions continue to be searchable.

## Performance Characteristics

- **Import Processing**: Additional 10ms per conversation
- **Search Performance**: No measurable impact on query speed
- **Storage Requirements**: 2-5KB increase per conversation
- **Memory Usage**: Negligible overhead

## Roadmap

Future enhancements under consideration:
- Extended output capture beyond 500 characters
- Additional git command pattern recognition
- General shell command output extraction
- Cross-project file modification tracking

## Getting Started

To upgrade to version 2.5.6:

1. Update the package: `npm update -g claude-self-reflect`
2. Rebuild Docker containers: `docker compose build`
3. Verify functionality by searching for recently modified files
