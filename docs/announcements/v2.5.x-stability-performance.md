# Claude Self-Reflect v2.5.x: Major Stability & Performance Update

## TL;DR

v2.5.x brings critical stability fixes and the new **streaming importer** for low-memory continuous import. Memory usage reduced by 60%, search latency under 10 seconds, and immediate search visibility fixed.

## 🔥 Critical Fixes (Hot/Warm/Cold)

### 🔴 Hot Fixes (Immediate Impact)
- **v2.5.1**: Fixed collection mismatch preventing immediate search visibility
  - Root cause: Project names extracted incorrectly from Claude logs
  - Impact: Recent conversations now searchable immediately
  - Validation: Certified by claude-self-reflect-test agent

### 🟡 Warm Fixes (Performance)
- **v2.5.2**: State file compatibility improvements
  - Better handling of incremental imports
  - Prevents re-importing unchanged files
  
### 🔵 Cold Fixes (Quality of Life)
- **v2.5.3-4**: Documentation and diagram improvements
  - Fixed README architecture diagrams
  - Cleaned up repository structure
  - Organized test files properly

## 🚀 New: Streaming Importer

The streaming importer is our answer to memory constraints and real-time import needs:

### Key Features
- **Memory Target**: 50MB limit (actual: ~26.9MB)
- **Real-Time**: Captures active sessions immediately
- **Resilient**: Stream position tracking survives crashes
- **Efficient**: Processes in small batches with garbage collection

### How It Works
```python
# Continuous low-memory import
1. Detect active Claude sessions (modified < 5 min)
2. Stream conversations from last position
3. Process in batches of 5
4. Save position & state
5. Sleep 60 seconds
6. Repeat
```

### Performance Metrics
| Metric | Before | After v2.5.x |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| Memory Usage | 150MB+ | 26.9MB |
| Import Reliability | OOM on 2GB | Works on 2GB |
| Search Latency | 15-30s | <10s |
| Container Stability | Occasional crashes | No crashes |

## 📊 Validation Results

Comprehensive testing by our claude-self-reflect-test agent:

- ✅ **Local Mode**: Working with FastEmbed embeddings
- ✅ **Cloud Mode**: Working with Voyage AI embeddings  
- ✅ **Memory**: 26.9MB (47% under 50MB limit)
- ✅ **Stability**: No crashes during 24-hour test
- ✅ **Latency**: Consistent <10 second responses
- ✅ **Accuracy**: 95%+ search relevance

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### Memory Optimizations
- Reduced batch sizes (100 → 10 messages)
- Per-file state saving prevents progress loss
- Aggressive garbage collection after processing
- Incremental state persistence

### Collection Management
- Fixed project name normalization
- Correct routing to local/voyage collections
- Backward compatibility maintained
- No user migration required

## 🎯 Impact for Users

### If you had issues with...
- **"My recent conversations don't show up"** → Fixed in v2.5.1
- **"Import uses too much memory"** → Streaming importer solves this
- **"Docker container keeps restarting"** → Memory optimizations fix this
- **"Search is too slow"** → Performance improvements address this

## 📦 Upgrading

```bash
# Update to latest
npm update -g claude-self-reflect

# Or fresh install
npm install -g claude-self-reflect

# Restart MCP server
claude mcp remove claude-self-reflect
claude mcp add claude-self-reflect "/path/to/mcp-server/run-mcp.sh"
```
