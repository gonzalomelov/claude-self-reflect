# Response to Issue #14: Feature Request: Selective Project Import with Configuration

Thanks for the excellent feature request! I'm happy to report that we've implemented project-scoped search functionality in v2.4.3 that addresses the core concerns you raised.

## What We've Implemented

### Project-Scoped Search (Default Behavior)
The MCP server now automatically scopes searches to your current project by default. This means:
- When you're working in a specific project, searches only return results from that project
- No more mixing of personal and work conversations
- Focused, relevant results without the noise

### How It Works

1. **Automatic Project Detection**: The system detects your current working directory and maps it to the corresponding project

2. **Default Scoping**: All searches are automatically limited to the current project unless you explicitly request otherwise

3. **Cross-Project Search**: When you need to search across all projects, simply ask the reflection agent to "search all projects" or use `project="all"`

### Examples

```python
# Default: searches only current project
reflect_on_past(query="authentication implementation")

# Search specific project
reflect_on_past(query="Docker setup", project="ShopifyMCPMockShop")

# Search all projects
reflect_on_past(query="error handling patterns", project="all")
```

### Using with the Reflection Agent

The reflection-specialist agent handles this seamlessly:
- Ask normally and it searches current project only
- Say "search all projects for X" to search globally
- Mention a specific project name to search just that project

## Benefits

1. **Focused Results**: No more wading through unrelated conversations
2. **Better Performance**: Searching single collections is faster than cross-collection search
3. **Privacy**: Project conversations remain isolated by default
4. **Flexibility**: Easy to search broadly when needed

## Future Enhancements

While this implementation addresses the immediate need for project isolation, we're considering additional features:
- Import configuration to exclude certain projects entirely
- Project aliases for easier reference
- Search history per project

The current implementation provides immediate value while keeping the door open for more advanced configuration options based on user feedback.

Try it out in v2.4.3 and let us know how it works for your use case!
