# Streaming Importer Memory Fix - MCP Pattern Success

## Date: 2025-08-15
## Status: ✅ SOLVED - Memory stable at 260MB

## Solution Summary
Successfully fixed the FastEmbed memory leak by implementing true async architecture following Qdrant MCP server pattern. The solution uses thread pool executor with `asyncio.run_in_executor()` to isolate FastEmbed operations.

## Key Implementation Details

### Architecture Changes
1. **Ground-up Async**: Complete rewrite using async/await throughout
2. **Thread Pool Isolation**: FastEmbed runs in isolated thread pool
3. **EmbeddingProvider Abstraction**: Clean separation of embedding logic
4. **Proper Memory Management**: gc.collect() + malloc_trim() after each file

### File: `streaming-importer-mcp-pattern.py`
- True async architecture with FastMCP pattern
- FastEmbedProvider using thread pool executor
- Handles both FastEmbed and Voyage AI
- Proper state management with legacy format support

## Performance Results

### Memory Usage
- **Before**: 3GB+ with crashes
- **After**: Stable 260MB (no growth!)
- **Files Processed**: 149+ without restarts
- **Processing Rate**: ~30 files/minute

### Test Results
- 660 pending files found
- Processing continuously without memory growth
- MCP tools working correctly
- No container restarts needed

## Production Deployment

### Docker Configuration
```yaml
async-importer:
  build:
    context: .
    dockerfile: Dockerfile.async-importer
  container_name: claude-reflection-async
  profiles: ["async"]
  mem_limit: 4g
  restart: unless-stopped
  environment:
    - QDRANT_URL=http://qdrant:6333
    - OPERATIONAL_MEMORY_MB=1500
    - MALLOC_ARENA_MAX=2
    - CHUNK_SIZE=5
    - THREAD_POOL_WORKERS=2
```

### Start Command
```bash
docker compose --profile async up -d
```

## Why It Works

### Qdrant MCP Pattern
- Thread pool executor isolates native memory
- Async operations prevent blocking
- True async from ground up (not retrofitted)
- Memory released between operations

### Key Differences from Failed Attempts
1. **Not Retrofitted**: Built async from ground up
2. **Proper Isolation**: Thread pool with executor
3. **Clean Abstractions**: EmbeddingProvider pattern
4. **State Management**: Handles legacy formats

## Migration Path

1. Stop old streaming importer
2. Deploy streaming importer
3. State file is compatible (handles both formats)
4. No data loss during transition

## Monitoring

Check memory usage:
```bash
docker stats --no-stream claude-reflection-async
```

Check processing:
```bash
docker logs claude-reflection-async --tail 50
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Thread Pool Isolation Works**: When done properly with async
2. **Architecture Matters**: Ground-up async vs retrofitted
3. **Follow Working Patterns**: Qdrant MCP server was the key
4. **Memory Management**: Native libraries need special handling

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Deploy to production
2. ✅ Monitor for 24 hours
3. ✅ Document in main README
4. ⏳ Consider switching main importer to this pattern
