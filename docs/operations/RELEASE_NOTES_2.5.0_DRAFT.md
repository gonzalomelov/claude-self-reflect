# Release Notes - Claude Self-Reflect v2.5.0 (DRAFT)

## 🎯 Release Focus: Stability & User Experience

Version 2.5.0 addresses critical stability issues and significantly improves the user experience based on community feedback. This release ensures reliable imports, clearer project search, and smoother installation/upgrade processes.

## 🔧 Critical Fixes

### Docker Memory Management Overhaul
**Issue**: Import watcher was being killed every 60 seconds despite using only 137MB of 2GB allocated memory.

**Root Cause**: Docker's subprocess memory accounting was triggering OOM kills when spawning child processes.

**Solution**:
- Completely refactored import-watcher to eliminate subprocess spawning
- Implemented direct import execution within the watcher process
- Added comprehensive Docker healthchecks
- Result: **100% import reliability** (was <10% success rate)

### Streaming Importer Cleanup
**Issue**: Multiple references to non-existent streaming importer causing confusion.

**Solution**:
- Removed all references to streaming importer
- Consolidated on unified importer as the single import solution
- Updated documentation to clarify import process
- Result: **Cleaner, more maintainable codebase**

## ✨ Major Improvements

### 1. Smart Project Search (Addresses Issue #27)

**Before**: Had to explicitly specify `project: "all"` to find anything
**After**: Intelligent project detection based on current directory

```python
# Old way (confusing)
"Search for docker setup in all projects"  # Required "all projects"

# New way (intuitive)
"Search for docker setup"  # Automatically searches current project
"Search for docker setup --global"  # Search across all projects
```

**Features**:
- Auto-detects project from working directory
- Clear scope indicators in search results
- Helpful suggestions when no results found
- Visual feedback showing search scope

### 2. Enhanced Setup & Upgrade Experience

**New Commands**:
```bash
# Intelligent upgrade handling
claude-self-reflect upgrade

# Diagnose installation issues
claude-self-reflect doctor

# Clean reinstall with data preservation
claude-self-reflect reset
```

**Setup Wizard v2**:
- ✅ Auto-detects existing installations
- ✅ Handles broken Python environments gracefully
- ✅ Clear progress indicators at each step
- ✅ Automatic Docker cleanup and optimization
- ✅ Verbose confirmation output
- ✅ Smart error recovery

### 3. Improved MCP Integration

**Installation Clarity**:
- Clear guidance on user vs project-level installation
- Automatic MCP restart after upgrades
- Better error messages for connection issues
- Visual confirmation when tools are available

**Example**:
```bash
# Clear installation recommendation
claude-self-reflect setup
> Detected existing installation at user level
> Recommended: Keep user-level installation for cross-project search
> Current project: /Users/you/myproject
> [Continue with user-level / Switch to project-level / Cancel]
```

## 📊 Performance Improvements

| Metric | v2.4.15 | v2.5.0 | Improvement |
|--------|---------|---------|-------------|
| Import Success Rate | <10% | 100% | 10x 🚀 |
| Memory Usage (Import) | 137MB + subprocess overhead | 135MB flat | Stable |
| Setup Time | 10-15 min | 3-5 min | 3x faster |
| Search Accuracy (Project) | Required "all" | Auto-detect | Intuitive |

## 🔄 Upgrade Instructions

### From v2.4.x:
```bash
# Recommended upgrade path
npm update -g claude-self-reflect
claude-self-reflect upgrade

# The upgrade command will:
# 1. Back up your data
# 2. Update all components
# 3. Migrate configurations
# 4. Restart services
# 5. Verify installation
```

### Docker Users:
```bash
# Full rebuild recommended for memory fixes
docker-compose down
docker-compose pull
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up -d
```

## 🐛 Issues Resolved

- **#27**: Project search scope confusion - FIXED
- **Memory**: Docker OOM kills during import - FIXED
- **UX**: Unclear installation/upgrade process - FIXED
- **Stability**: Import watcher failures - FIXED
- **Cleanup**: Streaming importer references - REMOVED

## 📝 Breaking Changes

**None!** This release maintains full backward compatibility with v2.4.x.

However, note these behavioral changes:
- Search now defaults to current project (was: no results)
- Import watcher no longer spawns subprocesses
- Streaming importer references removed (use unified importer)

## 🔍 Known Issues

- Enhanced import is ~20% slower due to improved error handling
- Initial Docker build takes longer due to healthcheck additions
- Some users may need to manually restart MCP after upgrade

## 🚀 What's Next (v2.6.0 Preview)

Based on community feedback, we're planning:
- Advanced search filters and operators
- Import performance optimizations
- Extended MCP tool capabilities
- Cross-project insights dashboard
