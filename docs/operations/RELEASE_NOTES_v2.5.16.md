## üîê Code Review & Security Fixes

Following comprehensive code reviews by **Opus 4.1** and **GPT-5**, critical improvements were implemented:

### Reliability Fixes
- **Signal Handler Race Conditions**: Fixed asyncio-native signal handling for clean shutdowns
- **CPU Monitoring Initialization**: Resolved uninitialized CPU tracking causing 0% readings
- **Queue Overflow Prevention**: Fixed data loss during high-volume periods
- **State Persistence**: Atomic file operations with fsync for crash recovery
- **Async Cancellation**: Proper task cleanup prevents resource leaks

### Security Enhancements
- **Input Validation**: Sanitized file paths and query parameters
- **Resource Limits**: Enforced memory and CPU quotas
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception management
- **Timeout Protection**: All network operations have bounded execution time

## üì¶ Dependencies

- FastEmbed (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) for local embeddings
- Qdrant v1.15.1 for vector storage
- psutil for CPU monitoring
- asyncio for async operations

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

New environment variables:
```bash
MAX_CPU_PERCENT_PER_CORE=25  # CPU limit per core
MAX_CONCURRENT_EMBEDDINGS=1   # Concurrent embedding operations
MAX_CONCURRENT_QDRANT=2        # Concurrent Qdrant operations
IMPORT_FREQUENCY=15            # Seconds between import cycles
BATCH_SIZE=3                   # Files per batch
MEMORY_LIMIT_MB=400           # Memory limit
MAX_QUEUE_SIZE=100            # Maximum queue size
MAX_BACKLOG_HOURS=24          # Alert threshold
```

## üêõ Critical Bug Fixes

### High Priority Issues Resolved
- **CPU Runaway**: Fixed streaming importer consuming 1437% CPU
- **Memory Leaks**: Eliminated unbounded memory growth in collection cache
- **Race Conditions**: Resolved state persistence conflicts during concurrent operations
- **Queue Overflow**: Fixed silent data loss when processing queue exceeded limits
- **Resource Cleanup**: Proper shutdown prevents orphaned processes and file handles

### Search & Metadata Issues
- **Search Quality**: V2 chunking migration fixed 66% searchability loss
- **Collection Creation**: Fixed async importer collection routing issues
- **Metadata Extraction**: Enhanced tool usage and concept extraction accuracy
- **Timeout Handling**: All operations now have proper timeout bounds

## üíî Breaking Changes

- Streaming importer now requires explicit CPU limits in docker-compose
- State file format changed (backwards compatible)
- Minimum Python version: 3.9

## üîÑ Migration Guide

For existing installations:
1. Stop current services: `docker-compose down`
2. Update docker-compose.yaml with new environment variables
3. Restart services: `docker-compose up -d streaming-importer`
4. Monitor CPU: `docker stats`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Limitations

### Minor Issues (Non-Blocking)
- **Search by Concept**: Currently returns no results due to metadata field not being populated during import (fix in progress)
- **Concurrent Search**: 10% of concurrent queries may timeout under high load
- **Voyage AI**: Cloud embedding provider not yet implemented in production streaming importer

### Workarounds Available
- Use `reflect_on_past` for general semantic search (fully functional)
- Single queries work reliably, concurrent load issues are rare
- Local FastEmbed embeddings provide excellent search quality
