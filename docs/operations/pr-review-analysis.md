## Open Pull Requests

### PR #43: Bump psutil from 5.9.8 to 7.0.0
**Status**: ❌ CI Failed (claude-review check)  
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM-HIGH  
**Regression Concerns**: 
- **Breaking Change**: psutil 7.0.0 drops Python 2.7 support (we're safe - using Python 3.10+)
- **API Change**: Removed `Process.memory_info_ex()` method (deprecated 8 years ago)
- **Potential Impact**: Need to verify we don't use the removed method anywhere

**Recommendation**: 
1. Fix CI failure first
2. Search codebase for any usage of `memory_info_ex()`
3. Test memory monitoring functionality thoroughly
4. Consider pinning to 6.1.1 if issues arise

### PR #42: Bump humanize from 4.12.3 to 4.13.0
**Status**: ✅ All checks passing  
**Risk Level**: LOW  
**Changes**: 
- Performance optimization using `math.log` for `naturalsize`
- Fix for `precisedelta` rounding

**Recommendation**: Safe to merge. Minor version bump with bug fixes and optimizations.

### PR #34: Bump actions/checkout from 4 to 5
**Status**: ✅ All checks passing  
**Risk Level**: LOW  
**Changes**: Updates to Node 24
**Minimum Runner Version**: v2.327.1

**Recommendation**: Safe to merge. GitHub Actions infrastructure update.

### PR #33: Bump python from 3.12-alpine to 3.13-alpine
**Status**: ✅ All checks passing  
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM  
**Regression Concerns**:
- Python 3.13 is relatively new (October 2024 release)
- Potential compatibility issues with dependencies
- Alpine Linux package availability for Python 3.13

**Recommendation**: 
1. Defer until more critical updates are complete
2. Test thoroughly in staging environment
3. Check all dependencies support Python 3.13

## Immediate Action Items

### 1. Fix CI Failure (PR #43)
The claude-review check is failing. This appears to be a CI configuration issue rather than a code problem.

### 2. Safe Merges
- PR #42 (humanize): Low risk, can merge immediately
- PR #34 (actions/checkout): Low risk, can merge after #42

### 3. Careful Review Required
- PR #43 (psutil): Fix CI, then verify no usage of removed APIs
- PR #33 (Python 3.13): Test comprehensively before merging

## Regression Testing Checklist

Before merging dependency updates:

- [ ] Run full test suite locally
- [ ] Test Docker builds with new dependencies
- [ ] Verify MCP server starts correctly
- [ ] Test import scripts with sample data
- [ ] Check memory usage reporting (for psutil update)
- [ ] Verify CI/CD pipeline still works (for actions update)
- [ ] Test with existing Qdrant installations
- [ ] Verify npm package installation flow

## Recommended Merge Order

1. **First**: PR #42 (humanize) - Safest update
2. **Second**: PR #34 (actions/checkout) - Infrastructure update
3. **Third**: PR #43 (psutil) - After fixing CI and verification
4. **Last**: PR #33 (Python 3.13) - Most risky, needs extensive testing
