# README Rewrite Summary - Naval Style

## What Changed

### Before: 363 lines of academic paper cosplay
### After: 100 lines of "here's what you get"

## Key Improvements

1. **Opening** 
   - Before: Paragraph explaining Claude's memory limitations
   - After: "Claude forgets everything. This fixes that."

2. **Installation**
   - Before: Buried at line 30
   - After: Line 5 - impossible to miss

3. **Value Proposition**
   - Before: Technical explanations of vector databases
   - After: Real examples showing actual Claude responses

4. **Memory Decay**
   - Before: 100+ lines of exponential decay mathematics
   - After: One paragraph - "Like your brain, but reliable"

5. **Architecture**
   - Before: 4-box technical diagram
   - After: 2-panel before/after user experience

6. **Removed Sections**
   - Motivation, Alternatives & Past Attempts (nobody cares)
   - Philosophy (save it for your blog)
   - Component deep-dives (moved to docs/)
   - Roadmap (promises are cheap)

7. **Added Sections**
   - "For the Skeptics" - addresses Reddit complaints directly
   - Real conversation examples that show value
   - 10-second technical summary

## The Naval Test

Every section now answers: "What's in it for me?"

- ❌ "Semantic search using vector embeddings"
- ✅ "Ask about past conversations. Get actual answers."

## Files Created

1. `README.md` - Complete rewrite (363 → 100 lines)
2. `docs/diagrams/before-after-sequence.md` - New diagram specs
3. `docs/meme-prompt.md` - Google Whisk prompt for meme generation

## Next Steps

1. Generate the before-after diagram based on specs
2. Create the meme using Google Whisk
3. Move old README content to docs/ for those who want details

## The Result

A README that a drunk developer at 3 AM could understand and install from.

Mission accomplished.
