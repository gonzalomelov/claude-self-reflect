# Code Reference Enhancement - Before/After Testing

## Baseline Testing (Before Enhancement)

### Test 1: Search for file "mcp-server/src/server.py"
**Query**: `mcp-server/src/server.py file`
**Results**: 3 matches (scores: 0.823, 0.772, 0.771)

**Observations**:
- Results are based on text similarity only
- Cannot directly filter by file paths
- Results include conversations mentioning the file name in text
- No way to know if file was actually read, edited, or just mentioned

**Sample Result**:
```
ASSISTANT: Now let me update the server.py file to fix the FastMCP name:
ASSISTANT: Now let me update CLAUDE.md with the corrected folder structure:
```

### Test 2: Search for Docker concepts
**Query**: `docker compose container dockerfile`
**Results**: 3 matches (scores: 0.814, 0.746, 0.734)

**Observations**:
- Semantic search works well for related terms
- Cannot filter by specific development concepts
- No indication of what Docker-related actions were taken
- Results include any mention of Docker terms

**Sample Result**:
```
ASSISTANT: Perfect! The scripts directory is mounted as a read-only volume...
ASSISTANT: I'll implement the fix and test it thoroughly...
```

### Limitations of Current Search:
1. **No File Tracking**: Cannot find conversations by files actually analyzed
2. **No Tool Usage Data**: Cannot see what tools were used (Read, Grep, Edit, etc.)
3. **No Concept Tagging**: Cannot filter by development concepts (security, testing, etc.)
4. **Text-Only Matching**: Relies entirely on text similarity
5. **No Action Context**: Cannot distinguish between mentioning vs. actually working with files

## Enhanced Testing (After Implementation)

### Prerequisites:
- [ ] Run enhanced import script
- [ ] Restart MCP server with new tools
- [ ] Test new search capabilities

### Test Plan:
1. **search_by_file("/mcp-server/src/server.py")**
   - Should return only conversations that actually read/edited this file
   - Should show whether file was read vs edited
   - Should include tool usage summary

2. **search_by_concept("docker")**
   - Should return conversations tagged with docker concept
   - Should show related concepts
   - Should include files analyzed in Docker-related work

3. **Traditional search comparison**
   - Run same queries with reflect_on_past
   - Compare quality and relevance of results

### Expected Improvements:
1. **Precision**: File searches return only actual file interactions
2. **Context**: See what tools were used and why
3. **Filtering**: Can search by specific concepts
4. **Actionable**: Know if files were read, edited, or created
5. **Discovery**: Find conversations by what was done, not just discussed
